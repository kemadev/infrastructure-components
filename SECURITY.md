# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to support the latest release, as well as the pre-release. You can find those current versions on the releases page. Anyway, if you discover a security vulnerability in a version that can reasonably be considered in active use, you can still report it as we are committed to provide best-effort support for those versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability related to this project, please report it by sending us a mail at `public-security@kema.dev`. We will review the reports as soon as possible and will discuss the best plan of action, including the disclosure of the vulnerability to the public.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it publicly. Please be sure that we will do our best to address the issue as soon as possible and credit you for your discovery if you wish. No legal action will be taken against you for reporting a vulnerability, as long as you come to us in good faith.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security of this project!
