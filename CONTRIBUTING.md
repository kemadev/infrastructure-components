## Proposing changes to the codebase or documentation

We use pull requests to do so. Here are the checks before submitting a pull request:

- The changes target the correct branch. You should usually iterate on `dev`, and submit the PR to `next` where it will be reviewed and merged to `main` when ready
- Continuous Integration pipelines are expected to pass. Please note that you can run some of them locally! Check [project's README](README.md) for more information
- Code changes are reasonable in size and scope (for bigger changes, consider splitting into multiple Pull Requests)
- Tests for the changes have been added
- Documentation and comments have been added/updated

Feel free to open a new pull request and we'll be happy to review it with you!
